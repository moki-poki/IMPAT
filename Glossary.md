# Glossary

**Purpose**: This glossary establishes shared vocabulary between domain experts and software engineers working on the Multi-Criteria Impact Analysis Tool for the Agrifood sector.

---

### Agrifood Sector

**Definition**: The integrated system of agriculture and food production, including farming, processing, distribution, and retail.

---

### Actor

**Definition**: Any stakeholder involved in or affected by the agrifood system, such as farmers, processors, consumers, policymakers, and suppliers.

---

### Criterion (Plural: Criteria)

**Definition**: A standard or principle used to assess and compare the performance or impact of different options or scenarios (e.g. environmental impact, profitability, social equity).

---

### Indicator

**Definition**: A measurable value that provides information about the performance of a criterion (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions for environmental impact, yield per hectare for productivity).

---

### Scenario

**Definition**: A defined set of conditions or assumptions used to model and compare different outcomes (e.g. introducing organic farming practices, switching to drip irrigation).

---

### Alternative

**Definition**: A specific option or strategy under analysis (e.g. crop rotation vs. monoculture).

---

### Weight

**Definition**: A numerical value that indicates the importance of a criterion relative to others in the decision-making process.

---

### Score

**Definition**: A calculated value representing how well an alternative performs with respect to a particular criterion or indicator.

---

### Aggregation

**Definition**: The process of combining individual scores and weights to compute an overall performance index for each alternative.

---

### Stakeholder

**Definition**: A person or group with an interest in the outcome of the impact analysis. They may provide input or be affected by the decisions.

---

### Impact Dimension

**Definition**: A thematic area in which impacts are assessed, typically including environmental, economic, and social dimensions.

---

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

**Definition**: A methodological framework that evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making, widely used in complex and interdisciplinary domains like agrifood policy and planning.

---

### Sustainability Assessment

**Definition**: An evaluation of how a system, practice, or policy contributes to sustainable development goals across ecological, economic, and social dimensions.

---

### Data Source

**Definition**: The origin of data used in the analysis, which could include satellite data, farm management systems, surveys, or public databases.

---

### Normalization

**Definition**: The process of scaling different indicators to a common range (e.g. 0â€“1) to make them comparable across criteria.

---

### Decision Support System (DSS)

**Definition**: A digital platform or software tool that helps users make informed decisions by analyzing data and presenting alternatives and impacts.

---

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Definition**: An analysis that examines how changes in input data or weights affect the outcome of the decision-making process.

---

### Trade-off

**Definition**: A situation in which improving one criterion results in the deterioration of another (e.g. increasing yield but decreasing biodiversity).

---

### Dashboard

**Definition**: A user interface that visually presents key performance indicators and analysis results in a way that is easy to interpret and interact with.

---

### Metadata

**Definition**: Data that provides information about other data, such as the source, measurement method, unit, and time of collection for each indicator.
